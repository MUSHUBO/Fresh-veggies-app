## Project Overview

**Fresh Veggies** is a simple web application built using **Next.js 15** with the App Router. The app features both public and protected pages with basic authentication handled via **NextAuth.js**. Users can explore the landing page, view product details, and, after logging in, access a protected product management page to add new products.  

This project is ideal for demonstrating Next.js routing, authentication, and protected route handling.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
